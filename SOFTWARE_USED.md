# Software Used

1. **PHP**  
   A server-side scripting language used to build the application with the Laravel framework. It handles backend processes such as authentication, event and inventory management, form processing, and database interactions.

2. **JavaScript (JS)**  
   A client-side scripting language used to create interactive elements on the web application. It enables dynamic content (e.g., the calendar), form validations, Bootstrap components, and responsive behavior in the browser.

3. **PostgreSQL**  
   SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to communicate with and manage the database. The system uses PostgreSQL (hosted on Supabase) to store users, events, inventory items, and related data through Laravel’s Eloquent ORM and migrations.

4. **Laravel**  
   A PHP framework used to develop the IETI School Activities Scheduling and Inventory Management System. It provides routing, authentication, MVC structure, and the Artisan CLI. The built-in development server (`php artisan serve`) is used for local testing and development.

5. **Composer**  
   A dependency manager for PHP. It is used to install and manage Laravel, Laravel UI, and other packages (e.g., Guzzle, Sanctum) required by the project.

6. **Supabase**  
   A hosted PostgreSQL service used as the database for the system. It provides a cloud database (with connection pooling) so the application can run without a local database server like XAMPP.
