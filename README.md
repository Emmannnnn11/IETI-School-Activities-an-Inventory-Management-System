## Sample Data

The system includes sample data:
- 20+ inventory items across different categories
- Pre-configured user accounts
- Event-inventory relationships

## Customization

### Adding New Inventory Categories
Edit the category options in `resources/views/inventory/create.blade.php` and `resources/views/inventory/edit.blade.php`.

### Modifying User Roles
Update the role definitions in `app/Models/User.php` and related middleware.

### Styling Changes
Modify the CSS variables in `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` to change colors and styling.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Check your `.env` file database credentials
   - Ensure your database server is running (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
   - Verify database exists

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Run `chmod -R 755 storage bootstrap/cache`
   - Check web server user permissions

3. **Composer Issues**
   - Run `composer install --no-dev` for production
   - Check PHP version compatibility

4. **Calendar Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify FullCalendar.js is loading correctly

5. **PostgreSQL: duplicate key value violates unique constraint on `inventory_items_pkey`**
   - This usually means the ID sequence is out of sync after import/manual inserts.
   - Fix by resetting the sequence to the current max ID:
     - `SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('inventory_items','id'), (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(id),1) FROM inventory_items), true);`

6. **PostgreSQL: same error on `event_items_pkey`**
   - Run the migration that syncs the sequence: `php artisan migrate` (migration `2026_02_02_000001_sync_event_items_sequence`).
   - Or run manually: `SELECT setval(pg_get_serial_sequence('event_items','id'), (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(id),1) FROM event_items), true);`

7. **Why are `event_items` IDs not 1, 2, 3, … 50?**
   - The `id` column is an auto-increment primary key. PostgreSQL (and MySQL) never reuse numbers: when you delete rows, the next insert still gets the next number, so you get gaps (e.g. 1, 3, 7, 12). This is normal and correct.
   - IDs are for uniqueness, not for display order. If you need row numbers 1 to N for display, use a query with `ROW_NUMBER()` or add a separate column; do not rely on `id` being sequential.
